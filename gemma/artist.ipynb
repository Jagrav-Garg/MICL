Light is not depicted as naturally occurring, but rather as emanating *from* the paint itself, creating a luminous, almost hallucinatory quality. The brushwork is energetic and directional, contributing to a sense of movement and unrest. The overall mood is emotionally charged, conveying a feeling of both intense passion and underlying turmoil, a blend of beauty and melancholy, and a deeply personal, subjective experience of the world.\n",
